This is a software to republish posts from a feed list (a.k.a. "feed planet"),
originally wrote and used for Les Blogs 2004 conference. It uses Universal
Feed Parser to retrieve posts, and store them in a database. Uses Django's
template system.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Legacy code! Worked on an old version of Django, probably needs update!
